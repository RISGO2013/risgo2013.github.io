href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell"
 title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">Robert
Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell</a></span> in 1907 organised an
experimental camp in Brownsea Island in Pearl Harbour, England for
a group of 20 boys in 1907. This was not a scout camp, but was the
birth of the Boy Scout movement which has now spread all over the
world.</p>

<p>Dharmaraja College, Kandy did not take long to follow his
footsteps, and in 1913, the 1st Kandy Scout Troop and the second in
Ceylon was formed. It was due to the enthusiasm and drive of the
then Principal, Mr. K. F. Billimoria when thetroop flourished
during his reign until his retirement in 1932. At the time the
scout master was late J. H. de Saram a Sinhalese, who became the
first native Chief Commissioner of Scouting in Ceylon, and his
assistant was G.H. de Saram.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>First great achievement</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1<span>st</span> Kandy Dharmaraja Scout Group has a
remarkable 99-year history in the local and international scout
arena with its very first great achievement, the "King's Flag"
which they won for three consecutive years, 1917, 1918 and 1919.
This flag was traditionally awarded to the troop in any one of the
British Colonies that had the largest number of King Scouts, on
September 30<span>th</span> in respective year. In those years the
number of colonies in the British Empire was quite a considerable
number and no other troop in the Colonies could emulate that
achievement.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. de Saram holds the unique length of time.</p>

<p>Dharmaraja Scouts won the Brigadier Hackett Thomson Championship
Flag for All-Round Excellence at the first ever All Island Rally
held at the Colombo Race Course in 1917.</p>

<p>Scout Henry Thenuwara was the sole Ceylonese representative at
the first Imperial Jamboree held in England in 1920 at the Crystal
Palace.</p>

<p>The Troop had the unique distinction of providing a
guard-of-honour when his Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales (later
King Edward VIII) visited Ceylon in 1921. This guard-of-honour was
drawn up on the platform of the Kandy Railway Station and was
personally inspected by His Royal Highness who paid tribute Rajans
on the very smart turn-out, thereby being the only troop in the
East to receive this recognition up to that date in 1921.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Honour the Founder</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1<span>st</span> Kandy Dharmaraja Scouts had the rare
opportunity to honour the founder, Lord Baden Powell in 1921 by his
visit to Dharmaraja College. Dharmaraja scouts had felicitated the
founder on three different occasions when over he visited Sri
Lanka. In 1924 the Troop produced the first Bushman Thong Scout
(Senior Scout Award) in Ceylon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="media/566/troop%20with%20baden%20as%20centerfigure%201920_497x360.jpg"  width="497"  height="360" alt="Troop with Load Baden as centerfigure 1920"/></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Summit which is on a promontory in the Lakeview Park within
the 57-acre land belonging to Dharmaraja, provides a panoramic view
of the surroundings, which had been allocated for the scout troop
by the then Principal, late Mr. P. de S. Kularatne in 1924. Later,
in 1984 this scout centre was named as the Lakeview Park
International Scout Centre. The Park which is modelled on the
famous Gilwell Park in London which was designed by Old Rajan Scout
Mahendra Nambuge, was given a new look with contemporary amenities
and will accommodate the foreign delegates who are due to here for
the anniversary celebrations.</p>

<p>In 1930 Dharmaraja Scouting carried a niche in the history, when
their founder Mr. J. H. de Saram was appointed as the first Native
Chief Commissioner of National Scout Association. He rendered a
yeoman service to the scout movement for a successful and
continuous 12 years.</p>

<p>The Troop won the Sir Andrew Caldecott Silver Cup for the Best
Troop in Sri Lanka in 1957 and again in 1958 when she won the
Island Merit Flag for being the Best Troop at the Kandy District
Rally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Exceptional three decades</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Late Mr. B. A. S. Wimalachandra rewrote history for being the
Group Scout Master for over three decades up to 1967. During his
lengthy stint, the scouts won accolades for several exceptional
achievements.</p>

<p>After his era Mr. Saliya Rajakaruna was appointed Group Master.
During his period vast improvement was shown with hiking, mountain
climbing, training camps and other scout activities added to the
discipline. Under the noble guidance of Mr. Rajakaruna, Dharmaraja
Scouts won the Island Merit Flag once again.</p>

<p>Dharmaraja scouts, again had the honour to hosting Mr. Dale
Sylvester, Asia-Pacific Scout Commissioner of the World Scout
Bureau, during his visit to Sri Lanka in 1971, when Mr. B. N. B.
Dolapihilla was the Group Scout Master. Mr. M. B. Weerasekera who
was the Group Scout Master from 1977 to 1993 had also received the
award from the Royal Highness for his admirable leadership,
creating another record during the Dolapihilla period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>World of Old Scouts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1977, Mr. M. Bandara Weerasekera was appointed as the Group
Scout Master of the College. Before the new rendezvous he was a
very talented innovator of the Group. Forming first ever old scout
association in Sri Lanka the "Old Rajans Scout Association" in
1978, November 12 <span>th</span>.</p>

<p>The then Principal of Dharamaraja College Mr. A. P. Gunaratna's
dedication and able guidance to scouting of the college, achieved
these chronicles in the history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Centenary JIM</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Dharmaraja College celebrated the Centenary year in 1987,
1<span>st</span> Kandy Dharmaraja Scout Group and the Old Rajans
Scout Association organized the 'Centenary JIM 1987' to commemorate
100 years in grand style. It was the very refreshing and
fascinating programme which any scout can remember with pride.
President J. R. Jayewardene the chief guest at the 'Centenary JIM'
paid tribute to the then principal A. P. Gunaratna and then Group
Scout Master Bandara Weerasekera and the organizers for conducting
a Jamboree of exceptional standard.</p>

<p>Mr. Sarath Mataraarachchi succeeded Mr. M.B.Weerasekera in 1993
as the Group Scout Master, who had accumulated more feats which
were impressive honours for the Group. His scouting expertise and
domination had targeted several feats.</p>

<p>From 1993 up to 2006, Dharmaraja Scouts won the Island Merit
Flag for being the Best Scout Group in Sri Lanka,
consecutively.</p>

<p>From 2007 scouting at Dharmaraja is actively supported by the
current Principal Mr. S. M. Keerthiratne.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Breaks Jamboree record</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thirty-one Dharmaraja scouts out of 138-member Sri Lankan
contingent participated at the 21<span>st</span> World Scout
Jamboree (Centenary Celebrations of World Scouting) from July
27<span>th</span> to August <span>8</span> in Gilwell Park, London,
England.</p>

<p>This is the first time in the history of scouting in Sri Lanka
that such a large number of scouts from one school was represented
at a world jamboree.</p>

<h3>Memorable Achievements</h3>

<p><span>Himalayan Expeditions</span></p>

<p>Dharmaraja scouts brought honour to the motherland in several
occasions, climbing the Himalaya Mountain seven times from 1985 to
2007. Expert Explorer Ajith Jayasekera, master of the Himalayan
Expedition guided the scouts with his experience.</p>

<h3>Memorable Events</h3>
